\# Tachometer Circuits

I have spent a great deal of work attempting to create a capacitive circuit for sensing RPM. I am not an electrical engineer, but after throwing many things at the wall I am getting something to stick.



the first circuit, has a 9200 something RPM (4t) limit due to it generating 5mS pulses each spark.

the second circuit seems far more reliable, but i am still testing.
